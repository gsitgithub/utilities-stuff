# mssql jdbc driver installation in maven for now on Nexus repository
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=sqljdbc4.jar -Dpackaging=jar -DgroupId=com.microsoft.sqlserver -DartifactId=sqljdbc4 -Dversion=4.0
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=sqljdbc41.jar -Dpackaging=jar -DgroupId=com.microsoft.sqlserver -DartifactId=sqljdbc41 -Dversion=4.1

==========================================================
Run this on the commandline; it should solve issue:
# sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

To do a specific port:
# sudo iptables -A INPUT -p <tcp OR udp> <--dport OR --sport> <port> -j ACCEPT

INPUT is the chain for incoming traffic. -p is protocol (either tcp or udp --dport or --sport specify allowing for destination or source port. -j is "jump" and its where you ACCEPT, REJECT, or DROP the packet(s)

Details on iptables can be found by reading the man page. Since you're a beginner you'll probably find this useful: http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO.html
